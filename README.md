# Kahunam CSS
Kahunam CSS framework

Inspired by Tachyons, TailwindCSS and BassCSS.

Principles:
+ Forward thinking. Support modern browser features.
+ Provide base styles for common use cases. All other CSS can be custom coded and built on top.
+ Adaptable - designed to fit in to existing projects without causing the bloat that a normal CSS framework would cause.
